1) Address of all the functions'ch we want should be invoked once the doc gets loaded will be stored in "onStartup"

2) A single page can have multiple accordions. Address of all the Accordions'ch are wanted will be stored in a ds called "accordions".
   ->"panels" will now be present at an index within "accordions"

3) We'll wrap the above 2 ds (onStartup and accordions) in "model"

4) user'll simply pass address of anonymous func
$$$.onDocumentLoaded(function(){
$$$.toAccordion(id);
});
The above is part of script and this particular func will be invoked when the document is being loaded

5) window.addEventListener('load',function(){
   $$$.initFramework();
   });
   ->Once the document has been fully loaded, function initFramework should be invoked
   ->Within initFramework, what'll happen is, onStartup array against model in'ch each element is the address of a func,those funcs will be invoked
   ->And in those func, toAccordion has been called
